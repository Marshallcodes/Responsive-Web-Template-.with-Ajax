<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 30px;"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.<br> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br><br>

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<br> enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<br><br>

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,<br> such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br> CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br><br>

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.<br> This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br><br>

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br> Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).<br> The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.<br><br>

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p><br>
