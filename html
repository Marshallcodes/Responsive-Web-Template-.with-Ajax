<br><br>
<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 35px;"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br><br>

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br><br>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "img" and "input" directly introduce content into the page.<br> Other tags such as "p" surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. <br>Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br><br>

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br> Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. <br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, <br>has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p><br>
