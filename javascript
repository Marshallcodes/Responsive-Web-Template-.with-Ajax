<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 30px;"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.<br> JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br><br>

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br> JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.<br> The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,<br> and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br><br>

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br> It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br> However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage,<br> or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.<br><br>

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js.<br> They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.<br><br>

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,<br> the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p><br>
