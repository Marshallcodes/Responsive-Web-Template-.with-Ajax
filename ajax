<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 35px;"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp" target="_blank">Ajax</a> (also AJAX /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for <b>"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML"</b>) is a set of web development techniques<br> using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications.<br> With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.<br> By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and,<br> by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.<br> In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.<br><br>

Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies.<br> HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information.<br> The webpage can then be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display—and allow the user to interact with—the new information.<br> The built-in XMLHttpRequest object, or since 2017 the new "fetch()" function within JavaScript, is commonly used to execute Ajax on webpages<br> allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page.<br> Ajax is not a new technology, or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways.</p><br>
